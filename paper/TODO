* Write conclusion
** The conclusion is a little bit too allusive about the missing forms to be handled by the analyzer. Could a better evaluation of what remains to described be given? For instance, in terms of percentage of 'static' forms for each POS?
** The paper is organized well however I can no see a nice conclusion section at the end of the paper. The conclusion is more like a future work section.
* fix abstract
* Check stuff
** grep FIXME and fix :(


* <Traubert> spectie: though do fix this: sometimes it's twol, sometimes twolc

* we have a free page (8 page limit), how about including a figure of example output for a paragraph of free text ?

==Done==

* finish eval stuff
* "has been widely used for other Turkic languages". Could you name the languages in the text (Turkish, Crimean Tatar and Turkmen)?
* Check stuff
** Check keywords
** check acknowledgements section
** Check JNW's rewording of "The direct result of this approach was a much smaller and simpler transducer." -> "... a more concise description"
** Check JNW's mention of further turkic transducers in future work section
* write evaluation script
* update numbers
** coverage
** stems
** tagset
** eg. we need to describe the evaluation
* update numbers
** statistics section
* the evaluation/statistics section needs adding to.. 
** Check \subsection{Morphological and orthographic words}
* "as depicted in table". There is no such table in the paper.
** Check the examples after "there are still a number of grammatical forms that have not been implemented"
** Check
*** What do you mean by "possessive morphology" and "case morphology"? Does that mean "possessive or case markers/affixes/suffixes"? Because you say "after a noun", does that mean that these are some lexical items?
*** I just changed the first occurrence of "possessive morphology" and "case morphology" to "p./c. affixes"; I think this is clear.  Maybe it was a problem with terminology?
